The first version was released in 2015, and it has since become one of the most popular container orchestration platforms.</p><p>Google donated Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2014, which now maintains the project as an open-source community effort.</p>",

        "<h3>The Container Revolution</h3><p>To understand Kubernetes' significance, we need to look at the evolution of deployment methods:</p><ul><li><strong>Traditional Deployment Era</strong>: Organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications, which caused resource allocation issues.</li><li><strong>Virtualized Deployment Era</strong>: Virtualization allowed better resource utilization and isolation, running multiple VMs on a single physical server's CPU.</li><li><strong>Container Deployment Era</strong>: Containers are similar to VMs, but have relaxed isolation properties to share the operating system (OS) among applications. Containers are considered lightweight, providing many VM benefits but requiring less resources.</li></ul><p>Containers became popular because they provide extra benefits, such as:</p><ul><li>Agile application creation and deployment</li><li>Continuous development, integration, and deployment</li><li>Dev and Ops separation of concerns</li><li>Observability of OS-level information and metrics</li><li>Environmental consistency across development, testing, and production</li><li>Cloud and OS distribution portability</li><li>Application-centric management</li><li>Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services</li><li>Resource isolation</li><li>Resource utilization</li></ul>",

        "<h3>From Borg to Kubernetes</h3><p>Google's internal container management system, Borg, was the predecessor to Kubernetes. Borg was designed to manage thousands of applications across clusters with up to tens of thousands of machines. Many of the developers who worked on Borg became key contributors to the Kubernetes project.</p><p>The lessons learned from developing and operating Borg over a decade influenced many aspects of Kubernetes design:</p><ul><li>API servers as the central control plane</li><li>Pods as the basic unit of deployment</li><li>IP-per-Pod networking model</li><li>Services and labels for service discovery</li></ul><p>Borg was not Google's first cluster management system. It was preceded by a system called Babysitter, and parts of Babysitter were incorporated into Borg. Google also developed a system called Omega, which explored a more flexible architecture for cluster management. Many of the innovations in Omega were subsequently incorporated into Borg.</p><p>In 2014, Google decided to take the lessons learned from Borg and create an open-source project that would bring container orchestration to the masses. This project became Kubernetes, with the first commit made on June 7, 2014.</p>",
